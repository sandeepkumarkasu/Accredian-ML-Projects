# **Problem Statement**
 The current process suffers from the following problems:
    1.   The company uses manpower to predict the medical expenses of its insurers. Many factors are considered
         such as age, BMI, smoking habits, number of children, etc.
    2.   It is a time and resource-intensive process and many times, inaccurate.
    3.   The company plans to modernize its legacy systems and wants to implement an automated way of predicting 
         the medical expenses of its insurers based on various factors.
